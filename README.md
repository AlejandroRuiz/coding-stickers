# coding-stickers

An application that leverages React, Redux and ImmutableJS and allows users to customize
their own notebooks using Stickers.

This is still a WIP.

## Running the Project

```
git clone <url>
cd ./coding-stickers/client
npm install
npm run start
```

## Tasks

  - `npm run lint ` - "ESLints" the project using AirBnb's guidelines.
  - `npm run test:watch` (or simply test) - Facilitates TDD. Run the tests and watch for changes.
  - `npm run start` - runs webpack locally
  - `npm run deploy` - deploys the application to surge
